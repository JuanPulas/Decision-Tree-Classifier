# Decision-Tree-Classifier
This project includes a decision tree classifier that uses Scikit-Learn's DecisionTreeClassifier(). 
The datasset is contains heart disease indicators and was extracted from Kaggle.

For experimenting purposes, I manually encoded values using the replace() function. A better approach would be to use sklearn OneHotEncode().

Also, for illustration purposes I set the minimum sample leaf at 20k so I could extract a visual of the tree (dataset is quite large).
